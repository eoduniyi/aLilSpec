# aLilSpec

 A The purpose of this blog is to keep track of and share interesting things learned in Spectroscopy and related areas of applied quantum mechanics. Additionally, this repo will serve as a space for documenting my contributions to the r-hyperSpec team, as well as, developments in the larger Computational Spectroscopy community.

## A return to `hyperSpec`
First, I should say I don't plan on writing a post everytime I contribute to hyperSpec or any related packages. However, I believe writing helps with organizing thoughts. And because it has been approximately two years since I've actually contribued to the hyperSpec ecosystem, I've gathered a lot of thoughts. So, as I return to make contributions I want to try an incentivze distillation Also, there are a number of things that I think are important to have in order before one contributes to an open source project, and specifically the r-hyperspec project and I wish to outline them here for myself and others.

### Contributing
I think contributing to an open source project can be super rewarding. For one, you get to interact with a number of interesting people from all around the world (e.g., the r-hyperspec team regularly represents 5/24 timezones). Second, it's an opportunity to improve one's skillset in the open. And of course, the reason one endeavors to contribute to an open source project in the first place is because they find the project cool, or its development important and ultimately worth learning more about. Personally, I think the R programming language is cool and I want to learn more about the nature of light, quantum computing, and their application to plant ecology and art (i.e., the purpose of this blog).

Additionally, there are organizations and programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) that give monetary rewards to students for contributing to open source projects during the summer.

#### Contributing Guidelines
Okay, so I've shared a few reasons on *why* it's a good idea to contribute to an open source project. In terms of *how* to contribute: The above mentioned Google Summer of Code organization gives some great tips [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/making-first-contact). But in essence, an open source project should have some sort of contributors guidelines. In theory, this document/page should tell one all they need to know about successful contributions. For the r-hyperspec team, this such document can be found [here](https://r-hyperspec.github.io/hyperSpec/CONTRIBUTING.html).

**And so**, because it has been **two years** I will now reread this document before making a contribution.

I have *cherry-picked a few sections that I think are particular important for any open source project to include guidelines about:

1. Coding contributions come in the form of bug fixes and/or feature additions. If the organization is using GitHub, then it is important to check the repositories issues tab first: Instead of "Great minds blah, blah, blah" I think it's "People have <s>similar</s> issues."

2. For people like myself, **consistency**, **test**, and **cohesion** can be scary in many contexts. In the context of software development, these are the primary activities of **quality control**.

3. There is "Publish or Perish", "Demo or Die", and "Document or Disintegrate." Vignettes in R package management are critical to documentation and guiding users through functionality.

1. Leave it to the chemist to come up with sound branch naming conventions. Pull requests (PRs) are where the collaboration goes down and can be a lot of fun!

1. When I first started contributing to hyperSpec in the summer of 2020 I had a bad habit of submitting large commits — perhaps a result of perfectionism — and writing opaque commit messages — some combination of laziness and confusion. Tbh I'm still working on both of these aspects.


**Of course, if you are interested in contributing to hyperSpec (or any project) then please read the entire contributing guidelines*

<!-- #### Setting up Systems for Contribution

### An Example Contribution
During the summer of 2020 I briefly wrote about *what* types of contributions one can make.

So as I make my contributions I will reference these guidelines


R, RStudio, Github, CI/CD -->
