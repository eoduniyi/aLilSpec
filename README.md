# aLilSpec

 A The purpose of this blog is to keep track of and share interesting things learned in Spectroscopy and related areas of applied quantum mechanics. Additionally, this repo will serve as a space for documenting my contributions to the r-hyperSpec team, as well as, developments in the larger Computational Spectroscopy community.

## A return to hyperSpec
First, I should say I don't plan on writing a post everytime I contribute to the r-hypespec team. However, I noticed that writing helps with organizing thoughts. And because it has been approximately two years since I've actually contribued to the ecosystem, I've gathered a lot of thoughts. So, as I return to make contributions I want to try an incentivze distillation Also, there are a number of things that I think are important to have in order before one contributes to an open source project, and specifically the r-hyperspec project and I wish to outline them here for myself and others.

### Contributing
I think contributing to an open source project can be super rewarding. For one, you get to interact with a number of interesting people from all around the world (e.g., the r-hyperspec team regularly represents 5/24 timezones). Second, it's an opportunity to improve one's skillset in the open. And of course, the reason one endeavors to contribute to an open source project in the first place is because they find the project cool, or its development important and ultimately worth learning more about. Personally, I think the R programming language is cool and I want to learn more about the nature of light, quantum computing, and their application to plant ecology and art (i.e., the purpose of this blog). Additionally, there are organizations and programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) that give monetary rewards to students for contributing to open source projects during the summer.

#### Contributing Guidelines
Okay, so I've shared a few reasons on *why* it's a good idea to contribute to an open source project. In terms of *how* to contribute: The above mentioned Google Summer of Code organization gives some great tips [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/making-first-contact). But in essence, an open source project should have some sort of contributors guidelines. In theory, this document/page should tell one all they need to know. For the r-hyperspec team, this such document can be found [here](https://r-hyperspec.github.io/hyperSpec/CONTRIBUTING.html).

AND so, because it has been two years I will now reread this document before making a contribution ðŸ˜…:

<!-- #### An Example Contribution
During the summer of 2020 I briefly wrote about *what* types of contributions one can make. -->

<!-- #### Setting up Systems to Contribute
R, RStudio, Github, CI/CD
