# aLilSpec
 A The purpose of this blog is to keep track of and share interesting things learned in Spectroscopy and related areas of applied quantum mechanics. Additionally, this repo will serve as a space for documenting my contributions to the r-hyperSpec team, as well as, developments in the larger Computational Spectroscopy communities.
